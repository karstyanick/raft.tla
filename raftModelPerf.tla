\* A leader's maxc should remain under MaxClientRequests

\* Check lower bound for message counts on committed entries ----
\* For any entry that has been marked as committed, verify that either the number
\* of AppendEntries requests sent OR the number of successful acknowledgments received
\* is at least the minimum number of followers required to form a majority.
\* will fail when an entry was sent twice to a follower and no response was acked yet, which is normal
